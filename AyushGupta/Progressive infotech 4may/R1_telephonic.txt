1. What is PEP 8 and why is it important?
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. PEP 8 is especially important since it
documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the
Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely
and strictly.


2. What is the use of self in Python?
Self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access
the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given
arguments.


3. What __init__ is a contractor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate
memory when a new object/instance is created. All classes have a __init__ method
associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from
local variables.


4. Explain how can you make a Python Script executable on Unix?
Script file must begin with #!/usr/bin/env python


5. What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?
xrange() and range() are quite similar in terms of functionality. They both generate a
sequence of integers, with the only difference that range() returns a Python list,
whereas, xrange() returns an xrange object.


6. What is pickling and unpickling?
Python library offers a feature serialization out of the box.
Serializing an object refers to transforming an python object 
into a byte stream format which can be stored, so as to be able to deserialize it.
function used are: pickle.dump()
Unpickling is the complete inverse of pickling. It deserializes the byte stream to
recreate the objects stored in the file and loads the object to memory.
pickle.load()


7. What is is PYTHONPATH in Python?
PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional
directories where Python will look for modules and packages. This is especially useful
in maintaining Python libraries that you do not wish to install in the global default location.


8. What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?
.py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, .pyc file contains the
bytecode of your program. We get bytecode after compilation of .py file (sourcecode)
.pyc files are not created for all the files that you run. It is only created for
the files that you import.
Before executing a python program python interpreter checks for the compiled
files. If the file is present, the virtual machine executes it. If not found, it checks
for .py file. If found, compiles it to .pyc file and then python virtual machine
executes it.
Having .pyc file saves you the compilation time.


9. Differentiate between deep and shallow copies.
• Shallow copy does the task of creating new objects storing references of original
elements. This does not undergo recursion to create copies of nested objects. It
just copies the reference details of nested objects.
• Deep copy creates an independent and new copy of an object and even copies all
the nested objects of the original element recursively


10. What is GIL?
GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock. It is used for limiting access to python objects and
aids in avoiding deadlocks. GIL helps in achieving multitasking (and not parallel computing).


11. Expalin Python memeory management.
