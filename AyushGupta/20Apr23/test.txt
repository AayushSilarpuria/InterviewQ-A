Question 1: 
single-digit "Reduced Subtracted Form": 
Given a number, you are expected to ﬁnd its single-digit "Reduced Subtracted Form (RSF)". 

The "Reduced Subtracted Form (RSF)" of a number can be found by concatenating the difference between its adjacent digits. To ﬁnd the single-digit "Reduced Subtracted Form (RSF)", we need to continue this process till the resultant RSF is not a single digit. 

Explanation: 
Input: 6928 → output should be 3. 5271 → output should be 1. 

RSF of 5271 (5-2) (2-7) (7-1) = 356 RSF of 356 (3-5) (5-6)=21 
RSF of 21 (2-1)=1 

Note1: input1 will always be >= 10 

Note2: Note that while concatenating the differences, we are expected to use the absolute values (non-negative) 

 

 

Question 2: 
Given a list of integers nums, write a function to ﬁnd the median of nums. The median of a list of integers is the middle value when the list is sorted, or the average of the two middle values if the list has an even number of elements. 

For example, the median of the list [3, 5, 2, 1, 4] is 3, the median of the list [3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 6] is (3 + 4) / 2 

= 3.5 

 

Question3:
Given a list of strings words, write a function to ﬁnd the longest string that can be formed by concatenating two or more strings from words in any order. 

  
For example, if words is ["dog", "cat", "car", "race"], the function should return "racetraceracecar", since "racetraceracecar" can be formed by concatenating "race", "car", and "race" in any order. 

  
Then ﬁndout the concatenating is palindrome or not if Yes return 1 else return 0 

 
 
 Question 4: 
Given a list of integers nums and an integer k, write a function to determine whether there exists a contiguous subarray of nums with a sum of k. 

For example, 

if nums is [1, 2, 3, 4] and k is 6, the function should return true, since the subarray [2, 3] has a sum of 

6. 
If nums is [1, 2, 3, 4] and k is 9, the function should return false, since there is no contiguous 

subarray of nums with a sum of 9.
