import inspect
def foo():
    return "foo"

# 4. Class method vs static method vs instance method

    # Instance methods need a class instance and can access the instance through self . 
    # Class methods don't need a class instance. 
    # They can't access the instance ( self ) but they have access to the class itself via cls . 
    # Static methods don't have access to cls or self .

# 5. When you use GET method for getting API;  explain the flow when the request get to the server.

import json

def jprint(obj):
    text = json.dumps(obj, sort_keys =True, indent= 4)
    print(text)

jprint(response.json())

action = response.json()['activity']
jprint(action)

print()

# 6.diff between tuple and list

print("Time:", stop - start)
